# Warcraft 3 FPS Unlocker
## What is this file for?
FPS Unlocker library (module) is dedicated to remove 64fps limit from 1.24e/1.26a patches and V-Sync along with FPS limit on 1.27a/1.27b/1.28f.

## What patches does it support?
1.24e/1.26a/1.27a/1.27b/1.28f.

## How to use this?
Simple place this file in your Warcraft III root folder or in Redist\Miles that also resides in the root folder.

## Are there any downsides?
Not as far as I know, this method has been used in my WFE (Warcraft Feature Extender) for years and no issues have been found.
The only potential "downside" could be ICCup's AntiCheat that seems to detect FPS Unlocker as a cheat, but that has not been really confirmed.
